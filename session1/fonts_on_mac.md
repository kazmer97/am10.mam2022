When you’re trying to plot with a font that is not actually installed on your computer, you’ll get something like a ‘polygon edge not found’ error.


If the given packages don’t help you find the fonts that you need, maybe try downloading the Google fonts from GitHub



DOWNLOAD GOOGLE FONTS THROUGH GITHUB

1.    Open this GitHub repo with all google fonts https://github.com/google/fonts 
2.    Scroll down and look for the section “Download All Fonts”
3.    Click the link below the title to start downloading the zip file of all Google fonts.
4.    Extract the downloaded zip file.
5.    Open Font Book and click the Add button or press Command +O to open the Add Fonts menu. Choose the Google fonts zip folder.
6.    Font Book will scan the download. Once it has scanned all the fonts you will be given an option to import these fonts, as well as any warnings for fonts that are not as complete or missing files. For any fonts identified as such go through and decide whether or not to add them depending on the warning.
7.    Use your fonts!
